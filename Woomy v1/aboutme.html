			<p class="mini"> Now playing: "Color Pulse" by Off the Hook </p>

			<p class="mini"> Oh, wow. About me huh? Well, if you insist. Let's see...<br/>
			My name is Erin. You can call me in any various nicknames (because people have different nicknames for me. Top contender is 'Eren'.)<br/>
			Born in the year of 1997, I am currently 20 years old. Turning 21 in January 24.<br/>
			I guess I <em>could</em> say I'm an introvert, INFJ. But so far nowadays I'm having a hard time convincing people.<br/>
			I'm probably the most biggest Nintendo fan you'll ever meet.<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh, you mean an autobiography? I see...<br/>
			I won't say much, I'm a private person, but here goes.<br/>
			I am the daughter of a doctor and a lawyer. I'm the eldest of the three siblings in the family.<br/>
			I aspire to be a game developer someday.<br/>
			Some people find me weird back when I was young, to the point that I was bullied for being so different from other people. I will admit I'm intelligent, but I was never the type to be the top person in class, probably because I'm too laid-back. Still now, actually.<br/>
			I used to draw in the past, actually I thought I might end up as an animator someday, but I had discovered the wonderful world of programming around 2012<br/> - starting with learning about Linux and its functionalities. <del>(Arch Linux master race)</del><br/>
			As I said earlier, I'm the Nintendo Freak. Nintendo was my first exposure to the gaming world, and later branched onto PC gaming (although I don't play PC as much as before). Today, I still have my Nintendo stuff with me - considering I always have my Switch around.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/header2.jpg" height="25%" width="25%"/><br/>
			<br/>
			Aside from gaming, I think the other hobby I have is to code just about anything. It's why I probably have an advantage over others since the moment I go home, this is the first thing and last thing I do before I go to sleep. (Or maybe, not at all. Keep coding.)
			<br/>
			Before BSIT, I have two previous courses, Pharmacy and Political Science. Both are influenced by my parents' profession. But my heart belongs to computers (and gaming).
			<br/>
			Alright. That's all for now. Glad you get to know me a bit!
