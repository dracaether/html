			<p class="mini"> Now playing: "Now or Never" by Nintendo </p>

			<p class="like"> + LIKES </p>
			<p class="mini"> Very obvious, but I love gaming! Ranging from RPGs, to Shooters. My favorite game of all time is Splatoon 2! (this is why this website is Splatoon-themed.) <br/>
			I love listening to music. My favorite artist is Adam Young/Owl City. <br/>
			I like fantasy, and because of that I play Dungeons and Dragons. I missed a lot of sessions lately. <br/>
			I am a huge fan of the musical broadway, Hamilton. 'Farmer Refuted' is one of my favorite songs. <br/>
			Another obvious thing, but I love everything Nintendo. Aside from the Switch, the Gamecube is my favorite console. <br/>
			I prefer Mac/Linux (or Unix) than Windows. I own an Arch Linux laptop and a Macbook Air. <br/>
			Of all the programming languages I tried, so far I like Python. Java is a close second, followed by Shell scripts. <br/>
			I like having a very flexible schedule. Just in case I have to do something, I can easily insert it on my schedule without ruining it. <br/>
			My favorite animal are penguins. My second favorite animal are squids. <br/>
			My favorite color is blue.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="dislike"> - DISLIKES </p>
			<p class="mini"> I'm a very quiet person most of the time, and so I don't like too much noise. <br/>
			I don't like it when my ideas don't go according to plan, but I tend to keep quiet about it. <br/>
			There are times that I am not in a talking mood, so I really don't like it if I'm forced to talk. <br/>
			For being highly empathetic, I dislike going in large crowds. I get too cranky. <br/>
			I don't like it when people put me on top of a pedestal. I am human, and I'm prone to mistakes. I'm no God.	<br/>
			I never tell this to anyone, but I don't like being interrupted - especially if I'm in a middle of explaining. I easily stutter if it happens. <br/>
			I don't like eating fish. I was traumatized in eating one when I was young. Oddly enough, I can eat tuna. <br/>
			I hate being late, to the point that sometimes, I cancelled my plans immediately if it happens. <br/>
			I am a morgenmuffel, a German word for 'A person who hates mornings'. <br/>
			I don't like skirts, at all. I guess the only time that I'll wear them if its part of the uniform, and I have no choice. I still hate them though.
