HELLO


If you're about to view this website/webpage/whatever, please install at least one of the following fonts (it's in the fonts folder):

'Splatfont 2'
'Project Paintball'

Not installing them is fine as well, it'll just default to Monospace - one of of my favorite fonts (although sure as heck looks okay if paired to the theme I seemed to keep using).

Both aforementioned fonts above belong to their respective owners.
